Liability of Carrier\nThe carrier of the goods described in this contract is liable for any loss of or \ndamage to goods accepted by the carrier or the carrier’s agent except as\nprovided in this Schedule.\n2. Liability of Originating and Delivering Carriers\nWhere a shipment is accepted for carriage by more than one carrier, the\noriginating carrier and the carrier who assumes responsibility for delivery to the \nconsignee (called the delivering carrier in this Schedule), in addition to any other \nliability under this Schedule, are liable for any loss of or damage to the goods\nwhile they are in the custody of any other carrier to whom the goods are\ndelivered and from which liability the other carrier is not relieved.\n3. Recovery from Connecting Carriers\ni. The originating carrier or the delivering carrier, as the case may be, is entitled \nto recover from any other carrier to whom the goods are delivered the amount \nthat the originating carrier or delivering carrier, as the case may be, is required\nto pay for the loss of or damage to the goods while they were in the custody \nof such other carrier.\nii. If there is a concealed damage settlement and the goods were interlined \nbetween carriers so that it is not clear as to who had custody of the goods\nwhen they were damaged, the originating carrier or delivering carrier, as the \ncase may be, is entitled to recover from each of the connecting carriers an \namount prorated on the basis of each carrier’s revenue for carriage of the \ndamaged goods.\n4. Remedy by Consignor or Consignee\nNothing in Article 2 or 3 deprives a consignor or consignee of any rights the\nconsignor or consignee may have against any carrier. \n5. Exceptions from Liability\nThe carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay to any of the goods\ndescribed in the contract of carriage caused by an act of God, the Queen’s or\npublic enemies, riots, strikes, a defect or inherent vice in the goods, an act or\ndefault of the consignor, owner or consignee, authority of law, quarantine or \ndiﬀerence in weights of grain, seed or other commodities caused by natural\nshrinkage.\n6. Delay\nNo carrier is bound to carry goods by any particular public truck or in time for any\nparticular market or otherwise than with due dispatch, unless by agreement that\nis speciﬁcally endorsed in the contract of carriage and signed by the parties.\n7. Routing by Carrier\nIf the carrier forwards the goods by a conveyance that is not a public truck, the\nliability of the carrier is the same as though the entire carriage were by public\ntruck.\n8. Stoppage in Transit\nIf goods are stopped and held in transit at the request of the party entitled to so \nrequest, the goods are held at the risk of that party.\n9. Valuation\nSubject to Article 10, the amount of any loss or damage for which the carrier is\nliable, whether or not the loss or damage results from negligence, shall be the \nlesser of,\ni. the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment, including the freight\nand other charges if paid, and\nii. $4.41 per kilogram computed on the total weight of the shipment.\n10. Declared Value\nIf the consignor has declared a value of the goods on the face of the contract of \ncarriage, the amount of any loss or damage for which the carrier is liable shall not \nexceed the declared value.\n11. Consignor’s Risk\ni. If it is agreed that the goods are carried at the risk of the consignor, that\nagreement covers only such risks as are necessarily incidental to the carriage\nand the agreement does not relieve the carrier from liability for any loss or\ndamage or delay that results from the negligence of the carrier or the carrier’s \nagents or employees.\nii. The burden of proving absence of negligence shall be on the carrier.\n12. Notice of Claim\ni. No carrier is liable for loss, damage or delay to any goods carried under the\ncontract of carriage unless notice of the loss, damage or delay setting out\nparticulars of the origin, destination and date of shipment of the goods and\nthe estimated amount claimed in respect of such loss, damage or delay is\ngiven in writing to the originating carrier or the delivering carrier within 60\ndays after delivery of the goods or, in the case of failure to make delivery, \nwithin nine months after the date of shipment.\nii. The ﬁnal statement of the claim must be ﬁled within nine months after the \ndate of shipment, together with a copy of the paid freight bill.\n13. Articles of Extraordinary Value\ni. No carrier is bound to carry any documents, specie or articles of extraordinary \nvalue unless by a special agreement to do so.\nii. If such goods are carried without a special agreement and the nature of the\ngoods is not disclosed in the contract of carriage, the carrier shall not be liable\nfor any loss or damage in excess of the maximum liability stipulated in Article\n9.\n14. Freight Charges\ni. If required by the carrier, the freight and all other lawful charges accruing on \nthe goods shall be paid before delivery.\nii. If upon inspection it is ascertained that the goods shipped are not those\ndescribed in the contract of carriage, the freight charges must be paid upon\nthe goods actually shipped with any additional charges lawfully payable on\nthe freight charges.\niii. If a consignor does not indicate that a shipment is to move prepaid, or does \nnot indicate how the shipment is to move, it will automatically move on a \ncollect basis.\n15. Dangerous Goods\nEvery person, whether as principal or agent, shipping dangerous goods without\nprevious full disclosure to the carrier as required by law shall indemnify the \ncarrier against all loss, damage or delay caused by the failure to disclose and such\ngoods may be warehoused at the consignor’s risk and expense.\n16. Undelivered Goods\ni. If, through no fault of the carrier, the goods cannot be delivered, the carrier\nshall immediately give notice to the consignor and consignee that delivery\ncannot be made and shall request disposal instructions.\nii. Pending receipt of disposal instructions,\nA.  the goods may be stored in the warehouse of the carrier, subject to a\nreasonable charge for storage, or\nB.  if the carrier has notiﬁed the consignor of this intention, the goods may be\nremoved to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the expense of the\nconsignor, without liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for\nall freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.\n17. Return of Goods\nIf a notice has been given by the carrier pursuant to paragraph i of Article 16, and \nno disposal instructions have been received within 10 days after the date of such\nnotice, the carrier may return to the consignor, at the consignor’s expense, all\nundelivered shipments for which such notice has been given.\n18. Alterations\nSubject to Article 19, any limitation in the contract of carriage on the carrier’s\nliability and any alteration to the contract of carriage shall be signed or initialled\nby the consignor and the originating carrier or their agents and, unless signed\nand initialled, shall be without eﬀect.\n19. Weights\ni. It shall be the responsibility of the consignor to show correct shipping weights \nof the shipment on the contract of carriage.\nii. If the actual weight of the shipment does not agree with the weight shown on\nthe contract of carriage, the weight shown on the contract of carriage may be\ncorrected by the carrier.\n20. C.O.D. Shipments\ni. The carrier shall not deliver a C.O.D. shipment unless payment is received in full.\nii. The charge for collecting and remitting the amount of C.O.D. bills for C.O.D.\nshipments must be collected from the consignee unless the consignor has\ninstructed otherwise on the contract of carriage.\niii. The carrier shall keep all C.O.D. money in a trust fund or account separate from\nthe other revenues and funds of the carrier’s business.\niv. The carrier shall remit all C.O.D. money to the consignor, or person designated \nby the consignor, within 15 days after collection.\n",

      "page_raw_text": "UNIFORM CONDITIONS OF CARRIAGE — GENERAL FREIGHT\n1. Liability of Carrier\nThe carrier of the goods described in this contract is liable for any loss of or \ndamage to goods accepted by the carrier or the carrier’s agent except as\nprovided in this Schedule.\n2. Liability of Originating and Delivering Carriers\nWhere a shipment is accepted for carriage by more than one carrier, the\noriginating carrier and the carrier who assumes responsibility for delivery to the \nconsignee (called the delivering carrier in this Schedule), in addition to any other \nliability under this Schedule, are liable for any loss of or damage to the goods\nwhile they are in the custody of any other carrier to whom the goods are\ndelivered and from which liability the other carrier is not relieved.\n3. Recovery from Connecting Carriers\ni. The originating carrier or the delivering carrier, as the case may be, is entitled \nto recover from any other carrier to whom the goods are delivered the amount \nthat the originating carrier or delivering carrier, as the case may be, is required\nto pay for the loss of or damage to the goods while they were in the custody \nof such other carrier.\nii. If there is a concealed damage settlement and the goods were interlined \nbetween carriers so that it is not clear as to who had custody of the goods\nwhen they were damaged, the originating carrier or delivering carrier, as the \ncase may be, is entitled to recover from each of the connecting carriers an \namount prorated on the basis of each carrier’s revenue for carriage of the \ndamaged goods.\n4. Remedy by Consignor or Consignee\nNothing in Article 2 or 3 deprives a consignor or consignee of any rights the\nconsignor or consignee may have against any carrier. \n5. Exceptions from Liability\nThe carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay to any of the goods\ndescribed in the contract of carriage caused by an act of God, the Queen’s or\npublic enemies, riots, strikes, a defect or inherent vice in the goods, an act or\ndefault of the consignor, owner or consignee, authority of law, quarantine or \ndiﬀerence in weights of grain, seed or other commodities caused by natural\nshrinkage.\n6. Delay\nNo carrier is bound to carry goods by any particular public truck or in time for any\nparticular market or otherwise than with due dispatch, unless by agreement that\nis speciﬁcally endorsed in the contract of carriage and signed by the parties.\n7. Routing by Carrier\nIf the carrier forwards the goods by a conveyance that is not a public truck, the\nliability of the carrier is the same as though the entire carriage were by public\ntruck.\n8. Stoppage in Transit\nIf goods are stopped and held in transit at the request of the party entitled to so \nrequest, the goods are held at the risk of that party.\n9. Valuation\nSubject to Article 10, the amount of any loss or damage for which the carrier is\nliable, whether or not the loss or damage results from negligence, shall be the \nlesser of,\ni. the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment, including the freight\nand other charges if paid, and\nii. $4.41 per kilogram computed on the total weight of the shipment.\n10. Declared Value\nIf the consignor has declared a value of the goods on the face of the contract of \ncarriage, the amount of any loss or damage for which the carrier is liable shall not \nexceed the declared value.\n11. Consignor’s Risk\ni. If it is agreed that the goods are carried at the risk of the consignor, that\nagreement covers only such risks as are necessarily incidental to the carriage\nand the agreement does not relieve the carrier from liability for any loss or\ndamage or delay that results from the negligence of the carrier or the carrier’s \nagents or employees.\nii. The burden of proving absence of negligence shall be on the carrier.\n12. Notice of Claim\ni. No carrier is liable for loss, damage or delay to any goods carried under the\ncontract of carriage unless notice of the loss, damage or delay setting out\nparticulars of the origin, destination and date of shipment of the goods and\nthe estimated amount claimed in respect of such loss, damage or delay is\ngiven in writing to the originating carrier or the delivering carrier within 60\ndays after delivery of the goods or, in the case of failure to make delivery, \nwithin nine months after the date of shipment.\nii. The ﬁnal statement of the claim must be ﬁled within nine months after the \ndate of shipment, together with a copy of the paid freight bill.\n13. Articles of Extraordinary Value\ni. No carrier is bound to carry any documents, specie or articles of extraordinary \nvalue unless by a special agreement to do so.\nii.
